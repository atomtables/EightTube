# EightTube

EightTube is a YouTube client for Windows Phone 8.1 (and W10M) that runs on the Invidious API. 
I made an app (exactly) like this back in the summer of 2023, but remade it since the computer
with its source code had a fatal crash and the app has since fallen into despair.

This app is pretty sentimental to me, as it's the first Windows Phone app I made, the first Microsoft-platform app
I made, and I made it using my grandfather's Lumia. I've always been obsessed with Windows Phones, and being
able to contribute to the development of a platform I like to use (even if that platform is beyond dead) is what
gives fruit as a developer. I also originally made this app because YouTube wouldn't work in IE11, and there is no
better feeling than creating an app which fixes a problem you have.

You will note that using your own Invidious API will result in a significantly smoother experience. In any case, with the
help of weidenwiesel at nerdvpn.de (big thanks by the way), you can use the app with a public instance. Also, because of
YouTube's attempts to take down invidious instances, Invidious may not be as reliable or provide the most accurate data.
Bottom line is it at least works.

There's only one commit because I absolutely hate Windows and Git on Windows and Visual Studio 2015's handling of git repos. (Even Xcode does a better job and Xcode sucks for git.)
